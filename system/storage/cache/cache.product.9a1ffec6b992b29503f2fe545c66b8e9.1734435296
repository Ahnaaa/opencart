The EOS 5D is unlike any previous digital SLR in that it combines a full-frame (35 mm sized) high resolution sensor (12.8 megapixels) with a relatively compact body (slightly larger than the EOS 20D, although in your hand it feels noticeably 'chunkier'). The EOS 5D is aimed to slot in between the EOS 20D and the EOS-1D professional digital SLR's, an important difference when compared to the latter is that the EOS 5D doesn't have any environmental seals. While Canon don't specifically refer to the EOS 5D as a 'professional' digital SLR it will have obvious appeal to professionals who want a high quality digital SLR in a body lighter than the EOS-1D. It will also no doubt appeal to current EOS 20D owners (although lets hope they've not bought too many EF-S lenses...) \u00e4\u00eb&lt;\/p&gt;","tag":"","meta_title":"Jonhwayne","meta_description":"","meta_keyword":"","discount":null,"special":null,"reward":"200","reviews":null},{"category_id":"33","store_id":"0","product_id":"31","master_id":"0","model":"Jonhwayne Volume2","sku":"","upc":"","ean":"","jan":"","isbn":"","mpn":"","location":"","variant":"","override":"","quantity":"80","stock_status_id":"6","image":"catalog\/jonh2.jpg","manufacturer_id":"0","shipping":"1","price":"15.9000","points":"0","tax_class_id":"0","date_available":"2024-11-03","weight":"0.00000000","weight_class_id":"1","length":"0.00000000","width":"0.00000000","height":"0.00000000","length_class_id":"3","subtract":"1","minimum":"1","rating":"0","sort_order":"0","status":"1","date_added":"2009-02-03 17:00:10","date_modified":"2024-12-07 14:34:10","language_id":"1","name":"John Wayne - Volume 50 Commemorative Issue: Celebrating Duke, Cinema's Favorite Cowboy, BTS Stories, I Love Lucy, Facts, Quotes, Rare Photos, First-Hand Accounts, Batjac Productions, The Alamo &amp; More!","description":"&lt;div class=&quot;cpt_product_description &quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt;John Wayne Collector\u2019s Edition presents John Wayne 50, a 100-page magazine featuring the facts, quotes and behind-the-scenes stories that certify Duke\u2019s legendary status.
